    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2lb (<em>32oz</em>) pork chops</li>
            <li>1/2cups (<em>64g</em>) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 <strong>large</strong> eggs</li>
            <li>2cups (<em>256g</em>) breading</li>
            <li>2cups (<em>16fl oz</em>) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1tbs (<em>15g</em>) Vegeta (<em>optional</em>)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>Large sautee pan</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First off, I like to work out some of my daily 
                stress by laying out the pork chops on some saran 
                wrap, covering the top with more saran, and tenderizing 
                the pork with a kitchen mallet.
            </li>
            <li>Next, we preheat our pan to medium heat. Pour in enough 
                oil to cover the bottom of the pan about a 1/4 inch 
                (<em>0.6cm</em>) deep.
            </li>
            <li>While our pan is preheating, whisk our eggs and 
                seasoning in a bowl. In a separate bowl pour out 
                our flour, and in another bowl pour out the breading.
            </li>
            <li>Now that our station is prepared and oil is heated, 
                take each pork chop and pat it down on all sides with 
                flour, then eggs, then breading.
            </li>
            <li>Drop each chop into the pan, making sure you drop them 
                away from you so the hot oil doesn't splash you. Each 
                side should fry for about 5-8 minutes until the breading 
                is golden brown and the pork has turned white.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer your schnitzel to a wire rack or place on paper 
                towels to drain excess oil. Serve with lemon, parsley, 
                mashed potatoes, and vegetable of choice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Smacznego!
            </li>
        </ol>
