    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>For our ingredients, we only need a handful of items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A medium-sized pot</li>
            <li>2 <strong>large</strong> eggs</li>
            <li><em>Cold</em> water</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, place them in the medium-sized pot and
                and cover the eggs with <em>cold</em> water by
                1 inch (<em>2.54cm</em>).
            </li>
            <li>Bring the water to a boil over <strong>high</strong> heat.</li>
            <li>As soon as the water begins to boil, <em>turn off the heat.</em></li>
            <li>Cover the pot and let the eggs sit for 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the eggs into a cold bath and leave them there for 
                another 14 minutes before you peel them.
            </li>
            <li>Take the eggs one by one and rap them against a plate or counter
                 and peel the shell away little by little.
            </li>
            <li>Smacznego!</li>
        </ol>
