    <p>This drumstick recipe is one of my favorite BBQ entrees.</p>

    <p>
        After a long day of work, I just want some food in my stomach.
        Usually, this means that I'm hangry and I don't want to be 
        cooking for too long. This is one of the easiest, most flavorful 
        chicken recipes I know, and now you'll get to enjoy it too.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb (<em>16oz</em>) chicken drumsticks</li>
            <li>2tbs (<em>1fl oz</em>) olive oil</li>
            <li>Your <em>favorite</em> chicken seasoning</li>
            <li>Medium-sized mixing bowl</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, take each drumstick and cut down the 
                line from joint to joint. Going along the bone 
                and flattening out the drumstick will "butterfly" 
                it.
            </li>
            <li>Pat each drumstick dry and place all of them in 
                the mixing bowl. Drizzle the olive oil over them.
            </li>
            <li>Once they're coated in oil, sprinkle as little or 
                as much of your chicken rub as you like. I personally
                enjoy <em>Kinder's Woodfired Garlic</em> rub and 
                use it liberally. Of course, the recommended amount 
                here comes down to preference.
            </li>
            <li>Marinate your chicken for at least an hour. For best 
                results, let is marinate overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Fire up your grill to high heat. Once the grill has 
                warmed up, place each drumstick cut-side down so it 
                keeps its shape. You'll flip the drumsticks once 
                every 5 minutes for a total of 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Once your 20 minutes is up, remove the drumsticks into 
                a serving dish and let them rest for 5-10 minutes. Plate 
                up with your favorite sides like corn and mashed potatoes.
            </li>
            <li>Smacznego!</li>
        </ol>
